# Three JS test

This library features the getting started tutorial from three.js and adds a listener to  the arrows in the keyboard to play with the cube.

## Installation

I used the http-server for node so you must run npm install

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

Start the server by running npm start

```bash
npm start
```

Then navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and you will be able to see the project running
